<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Hello, I see you want a setup for hyprland, since you entered this repo. Do you want one like mine?<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L5iOA6Ml.png" alt="The setup"></p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>This needs the following:
<ol>
<li>Kitty</li>
<li>Hyprland</li>
<li>Swaybar</li>
<li>Hyprpaper (or replace for another wallpaper system)</li>
<li>Swaync (or replace for another swaybar / waybar notification center)</li>
<li>Nautilius (or replace with another file manager)</li>
<li>A hycursor (by default uses rose-pine hyprcursor but a place to find some is https://github.com/sakshatshinde/hyprcursor-themes )</li>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the Code</li>
<li>Place the hyprland config in Home/.config/Hypr</li>
<li>Place the Hyprpaer in the same directory</li>
<li>Place the wallpaper somewhere (or use another one)</li>
<li>Replace the “PLACE THE DIRECTORY OF A WALLPAPER HERE” and “PLACE THE SAME DIRECTORY HERE” with the directory of the wallpaper</li>
<li>Open <a href="https://github.com/Anik200/dotfiles">https://github.com/Anik200/dotfiles</a> (MAKE SURE IT IS THE MAIN BRANCH) (since it is not my swaybar config)</li>
<li>Download the code</li>
<li>Extract and install all fonts included in the additional resources folder</li>
<li>Put the files (except <a href="http://mouse.sh">mouse.sh</a>, not needed) in -   <code>~/.config/waybar/</code><br>
10.Done!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="helping">Helping</h2>
<p>If I listed a step wrong / there is a better method, then open an issue / do a merge request!</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>By default, apps are dark mode. The config file for hyperland tries to fix this but it does not work. Please help if you can with this! Another thing that is not an issue on its own, this does not include a menu to open apps, you have to make that your self.</p>
