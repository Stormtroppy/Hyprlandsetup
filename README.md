<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Hello, I see you want a setup for hyprland, since you entered this repo. Do you want one like mine?<br>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/L5iOA6Ml.png" alt="The setup"></p>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>This needs the following:<br>
Kitty<br>
Hyprland<br>
Swaybar<br>
Hyprpaper (or replace for another wallpaper system)<br>
Swaync (or replace for another swaybar / waybar notification center)</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download the Code</li>
<li>Place the hyprland config in Home/.config/Hypr</li>
<li>Place the Hyprpaer in the same directory</li>
<li>Place the wallpaper somewhere (or use another one)</li>
<li>Replace the “PLACE THE DIRECTORY OF A WALLPAPER HERE” and “PLACE THE SAME DIRECTORY HERE” with the directory of the wallpaper</li>
<li>Open <a href="https://github.com/Anik200/dotfiles">https://github.com/Anik200/dotfiles</a> (MAKE SURE IT IS THE MAIN BRANCH) (since it is not my swaybar config)</li>
<li>Download the code</li>
<li>Extract and install all fonts included in the additional resources folder</li>
<li>Put the files (except <a href="http://mouse.sh">mouse.sh</a>, not needed) in -   <code>~/.config/waybar/</code><br>
10.Done!</li>
</ol>

<p>If I listed a step wrong / there is a better method, then open an issue / do a merge request!</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>By default, apps are dark mode. The config file for hyperland tries to fix this but it does not work. Please help if you can with this!</p>
